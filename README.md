# Repository
Okay… here’s the deal.

I made this repo as a little rebel act against all the LinkedIn NPC energy. You know the type—endless buzzwords, fake professionalism, everyone pretending they’re something they’re not. Yeah, I hate that.

So, here’s a blank space. No rules. No scripts. Just a place to actually build stuff, experiment, and be real.

This is for people (or ideas) that care more about doing than pretending, more about creating than posting.

Sometimes the best rebellion is just showing up and making something real.

So yeah… the repo’s empty for now. But it’s ready for the real work—the stuff that matters.
